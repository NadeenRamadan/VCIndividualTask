pull request meaning:
  Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. 
  Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators 
  and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
  
  
difference between(git revert, git restore, git reset):
  1-git revert should be used to undo changes on a public branch.
  2-git restore is about restoring files in the working tree from either the index or another commit.
  2-git reset should be reserved for undoing changes on a private branch.
